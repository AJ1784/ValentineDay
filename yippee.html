It feels like just yesterday we started talking, and already, I can't imagine not having you by my side. These past two months have been an incredible journey, and I'm so grateful for every moment we've shared.From the first time we met at Tealicious, I had a feeling there was something special about you. Your warmth, your kindness, it all drew me in, and I knew I wanted to get to know you better. And here we are, sharing late-night conversations over FaceTime during the break, and I couldn't be happier. You've been such an amazing person, treating me with so much care and spending your time with me. I've never felt more understood and appreciated than when I'm with you. It's like I've found a second home in your room( nah like litearly), and your arms have become my sanctuary. As we approach Valentine's Day, I can't help but feel excited about what the future holds for us. This day is just the beginning of many beautiful moments we'll share together. With you, I feel like I can take on anything that comes our way. Thank you for being you, Ami. Thank you for bringing so much joy and love into my life. Here's to many more adventures, late-night talks, and unforgettable moments together. I'm beyond grateful to have you as my Valentine and as someone I can call mine";
